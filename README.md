# Coaching at Dev Academy

Coaching is your way to request teaching tailored to your specific needs.

## [Waffle board](https://waffle.io/enspiral-dev-academy/coaching)

This repo is for organising individual or small group coaching sessions.

Coaching can be in bootcamp hours, lunch times or in the evenings or weekends (if there is a coach available)

Sessions can be one on one or small groups and can cover any topic you like. 

To request coaching create an issue on the [waffle board](https://waffle.io/enspiral-dev-academy/coaching) and we'll aim to get you support as soon as we can.
